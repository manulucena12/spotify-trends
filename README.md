# The Evolution of Music from 2000 to 2023: A Spotify Data Analysis

This dataset has been retrieved from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/amitanshjoshi/spotify-1million-tracks). I chose this dataset because I love listening to music and wanted hands-on practice in a data analysis project. My goal is to explore what makes a song more popular and how the music industry has evolved over time.

## Visualization
